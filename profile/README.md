# Various Quarto Extensions

Welcome to [@coatless](https://github.com/coatless) and contributors' collection of Quarto extensions! 
This GitHub organization serves as a central repository for unofficial extensions that enhance Quarto's capabilities in document generation, formatting, and presentation. 
Each extension is maintained in its own repository, making it easy to find, use, and contribute to specific projects.

## Getting Started

To use any of the extensions:

1. Visit the specific extension's repository
2. Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository's README
3. Add the extension to your Quarto project's `_quarto.yml` file or document YAML header
4. Use the extension features as documented in the repository

## Installation Requirements

Most extensions require:
